               <p>The World Bank Group and the international development community 
                consider that knowledge sharing is an effective catalyst for 
                accelerating development processes.

                <br>
                Learning from peers is often far more convincing and powerful 
                than learning from books or theoretical experts. It provides 
                decision makers with practical insights about approaches that 
                work, and pitfalls to avoid. At the political level, 
                peer-learning inspires leaders to implement reforms, while 
                at the technical level it allows for exchanging practical 
                ‘how-to’ knowledge for solving problems. Knowledge sharing 
                is an important building block towards achieving the Agenda 
                2030 for Sustainable Development.

                Launched in October 2008 as a multi donor trust fund, 
                the South South Experience Exchange Facility South South 
                Facility or SSF enables the sharing of development experiences 
                and knowledge among World Bank Group client countries by funding
                knowledge exchange activities. The South-South Facility funds 
                these knowledge exchanges based on demand expressed by the 
                knowledge recipient countries. They are designed with a focus 
                on achieving results.</p>

                <p>In ten years of operations, the South South Facility 
                has supported more than two hundred forty knowledge exchanges

                The exchange increased participant knowledge and 
                skills, particularly in policy development, by

                urban poor. Also, by improving the operational efficiency of 
                the national program for informal settler families in
                danger areas such as those susceptible to floods
                and other natural disasters.

                Raising awareness on the importance of coordination

                of a Filipino incentive and subsidy framework that is 
                expected to engage the private sector in the low-income 
                housing market, and enable in city relocation of those

                Enhancing networks among stakeholders in the Philippines.
                 After the exchange, the participants were able to engage 
                 more stakeholders, including key shelter agencies, which 
                 are now more closely coordinating their programs and 
                 initiatives within a national framework.</p>
