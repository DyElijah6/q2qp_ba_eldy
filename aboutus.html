            Launched in 2008 as a multi donor trust fund administered by 
            the World Bank, the South South Facility helps developing and 
            emerging countries address development challenges and implementation bottlenecks. 
            It was established to help countries do development differently. The Facility finances 
            global knowledge exchanges that draw directly upon the expertise of developing and/or 
            emerging countries and provides a platform for sharing lessons. As knowledge exchanges 
            don’t happen in isolation, grants are awarded to country teams that work with the World 
            Bank to integrate the lessons learned from the exchanges in their efforts to achieving 
            their broader development goals. The South-South Facility also helps teams document their 
            results and lessons learned so that other practitioners may benefit from them.

            <p>The Philippines requested World Bank support for an exchange with Brazil to
                 learn from its coordinated efforts in incorporating urban housing in its national
                  development strategy and to promote inclusive, effective, and sustainable approaches
                   to low income shelter.

                Filipino participants came from national and local government, including housing authorities,
                 led by the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. Brazilian knowledge providers
                  were officials of the Cities, Finance, and Planning and Budget ministries as well as municipal
                   and local housing agencies. The exchange included:

                Planning Sessions. Participants engaged in several planning sessions, including one on September 26, 2013, 
                to determine the scope and objectives of, and schedule for, a study visit to Brazil.

                Study Visit to Brazil. Eight Filipino officials and one representative of the private sector 
                visited Brazil during November 18 22, 2013. They met with officials in Brasilia to gain an 
                overview of national housing and infrastructure policies and programs as well as subsidies 
                programs. They also visited Sao Paulo and observed approaches to urbanization and land regularization
                 of informal settlements; social work and condominium management in low income housing communities; 
                 data collection and monitoring; and coordination of federal housing programs at the local level. 
                 They also visited communities with housing for those relocated from areas at risk of flooding and
                  landslides. The study visit concluded with a brainstorming session where key lessons learned and 
                  replication potential of the Brazilian case, were discussed.

                Post Visit Peer to Peer Consultations and Roundtable. The Bank facilitated two follow up
                 workshops: one on June 26, focused on estate management of low income housing 
                 experiences from Brazil, and another on August 27,  focused on citywide informal
                  settlement upgrading. It also organized a roundtable discussion for participants to
                   discuss key lessons learned and their applicability in the Filipino context, and
                    to facilitate action planning of next steps. The dates all occuring in the year twenty forteen.</p>

            To deliver development results through knowledge sharing, the World Bank has developed
             and tested a range of knowledge transfer tools. They incorporate lessons from over
              100 exchanges financed by the South-South Facility and are designed to deliver maximum impact.
               Complemented by the support of trained knowledge exchange facilitators, these tools form the
                bedrock of the Facility’s integrated knowledge sharing approach.
            <br><br>
        The Art of Knowledge Exchange is a planning guide that helps practitioners design and implement
        results focused knowledge exchanges. It offers guidance on how to plan for results, how to
        deliver an impactful knowledge exchange and for measuring development outcomes.
        <br><br>
        The handbook Becoming A Knowledge Sharing Organization offers a 
        methodology for the development of a knowledge sharing culture 
        within an organization. It shows how to build the enabling environment
         and to develop the technical skills needed to capture, package and share
          knowledge gained from operational experiences. Knowledge providing institutions
           involved in programmatic knowledge exchanges can benefit from this type of support
            to strengthen their knowledge-sharing capacity.
            <br><br>
        These tools as well as a self paced e learning course, and a Guide for Designing and Implementing 
        Study Tours are made publicly available in several languages and can be downloaded from this website.
