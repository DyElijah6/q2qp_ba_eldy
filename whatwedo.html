            To develop a national framework for providing housing
             and shelter options for the marginalized urban poor,
              officials from the Philippines engaged in an exchange
               with Brazil. They learned how to develop subsidy and 
               incentive programs to engage a wide cross section of 
               public and private stakeholders, developing their own 
               National Informal Settlements Upgrading Strategy.

            The Philippines requested World Bank support for an exchange with Brazil to learn from its 
            coordinated efforts in incorporating urban housing in its national development strategy and
             to promote inclusive, effective, and sustainable approaches to low income shelter.

        Filipino participants came from national and local government, 
        including housing authorities, led by the Housing and Urban Development
         Coordinating Council. Brazilian knowledge providers were officials of 
         the Cities, Finance, and Planning and Budget ministries as well as municipal 
         and local housing agencies. The exchange included:
         <br><br>  
        Planning Sessions. Participants engaged in several planning sessions, including
         one on September 26, 2013, to determine the scope and objectives of, and schedule 
         for, a study visit to Brazil.
         <br><br>  
        Study Visit to Brazil. Eight Filipino officials and one representative of the private
         sector visited Brazil during November 18 22, 2013. They met with officials in Brasilia
          to gain an overview of national housing and infrastructure policies and programs as
           well as subsidies programs. They also visited Sao Paulo and observed approaches to
            urbanization and land regularization of informal settlements; social work and
             condominium management in low income housing communities; data collection and monitoring;
              and coordination of federal housing programs at the local level. They also visited
               communities with housing for those relocated from areas at risk of flooding and
                landslides. The study visit concluded with a brainstorming session where key
                 lessons learned and replication potential of the Brazilian case, were discussed.
                 <br><br>  
        Post Visit Peer to Peer Consultations and Roundtable. The Bank facilitated two follow up workshops:
         one on June 26, focused on estate management of low income housing experiences from Brazil,
          and another on August 27, focused on citywide informal settlement upgrading. It
           also organized a roundtable discussion for participants to discuss key lessons learned
            and their applicability in the Filipino context, and to facilitate action planning of next steps. The dates
            occurred in twenty forteen.
